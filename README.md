Task description:

- I need to create a class - Manager, what contains logic:

- Implement a search for goods by colour

- Sort goods by price, weight

- The implementation of sorting should provide the ability to sort both in descending and ascending order

- I need to use the built-in sorting methods available in Java to sort

- Sorting should be implemented in a separate method

- I can use only one static method (void)
